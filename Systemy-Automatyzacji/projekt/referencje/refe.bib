  abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive literature survey on fractional-order optimal control problems. Fractional-order differential equation is extensively used nowadays to model real-world systems accurately, which exhibit fractal dimensions, memory effects, as well as chaotic behaviour. These versatile features attract engineers to concentrate more on this, and it is widely used in the broad domain of science and technology. The mentioned numerical tools take the necessary optimal conditions into account, which makes it a two-point boundary value problem of non-integer order. In this review article, some numerical approaches for the approximation have been stated for obtaining the solution to fractional optimal control problems (FOCPs). Here, few numerical approaches including Grunwald-Letnikov approximation, Adams type predictor-corrector method, generalized Euler’s method, Caputo-Fabrizio method Bernoulli and Legendre polynomials method, Legendre operational method, and Ritz’s and Jacobi’s method are treated as an advanced method to obtain the solution of FOCP. Fractional delayed optimal control is selected for our investigation. It refers to a type of control problem where the control action is delayed by a fractional amount of time. In other words, the control input at a given time depends not only on the current state of the system but also on its past state at fractional times. The fractional delayed optimal control problem is formulated as an optimization problem that seeks to minimize a cost function subject to a set of constraints that represent the dynamics of the system and the fractional delay in the control input. The solution to this problem typically involves the use of fractional polynomials types, i.e. Chebyshev and Bassel polynomials.},

Fractional-order controllers are based on the rapidly evolving scientific field called fractional-order calculus. Its concepts are applicable in solving many scientific and engineering problems, including robust control system design. The fractional PID is a natural evolution of the conventional PID controller and as such new tuning strategies are now possible due to enhanced accuracy of the fractional-order models. The presented tool, which is a part of FOMCON - a MATLAB fractional-order calculus oriented toolbox, - uses numerical optimization methods to carry out the tuning and obtain a controller for a chosen plant to be controlled, which can either be a fractional-order plant or an integer-order plant.},

  abstract = {While the demand for new high-tech technologies is rapidly increasing, difficulties are presented, such as aging and population decline in rural areas. In particular, autonomous mobile robots have been emerging in the agricultural field. Worldwide, huge investment is being made in the development of unmanned agricultural mobile robots; meanwhile with the development of robots, modern farms have high expectations of increased productivity. However, in the agricultural work environment, it is difficult to solve these problems with the existing mobile robot form, due to the difficulties of various environments. Typical problems are space constraints in the agricultural work environment, the high computational complexity of algorithms, and changes in the environment. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a method to design and operate a mobile robot platform that can be used in a greenhouse. We represent a robot type with two drive wheels along with four casters that can operate on path and rail. In addition, we propose a technology for a multi-AI deep learning system to operate a robot, an algorithm that can operate such a robot, and a VPN-based communication system for network and security. The proposed method is expected to increase productivity and reduce labor costs in the agricultural work environment.},

To illustrate the usefulness of our theoretical results, a fractional HIV population model and a fractional cellular model are studied. More precisely, we construct suitable Lyapunov functionals to demonstrate the global stability of the free and endemic equilibriums, for both fractional models, and we also perform some numerical simulations that confirm our choices.},

To depict a time-fractional order plant virus model including disease consequences, we suggested a set of fractional differential equations. For the fractional order system, both qualitative and quantitative studies are carried out. To prove the existence and uniqueness of the proposed model with the effect of global derivative, Linear growth and Lipschitz conditions are used. Positiveness and boundedness of solutions of the fractional order model are verified. Local stability analysis and global stability is verified by using the Lyapunov function with the first and second derivative tests. Sensitivity analysis is performed to see the influence of parameters on the fractional order model. To study the effect of the fractional operator, which demonstrates the impact of the illness on plants, solutions are generated with a two-step Lagrange polynomial in the generalized form of the Mittag-Leffler kernel. To observe the behavior of the fractional order plant virus model, numerical simulation is used. Such an inquiry will help to comprehend how the virus behaves and to create defences against infected plants.},

Using this method significantly simplify process of prototyping the control law and structure of close-loop system. Furthermore using this method reduced cost rebuilt the plant on the prototype stage. Above procedure are shown on the base two structure: beam structure and bar structure. In the first stage of the prototyping the MES were used to find quasi-optimal localization piezo-sensor and piezo-actuator in the structure. Next the cost functions modal forces and modal displacement was created in goal obtain the mathematical model structures. In the second stage, the structures with piezo-elements were designed and tested in the lab. The more exact mathematical model of the structure was obtained as a result of the identification procedure. Next the correct control law was used to investigation dynamic of the closed-loop system in the lab stands. Obtained results in both cases have proved that these procedure is correctly. In this way was obtained additional damp in the systems which also excellent reduce vibration the both mechanical structures.},

There are several well-established techniques to compute Lyapunov exponent of integer-order systems, however, these techniques failed to generalize to fractional-order systems due to the nonlocality of fractional-order derivatives. In this paper, a method for determining the Lyapunov exponent spectrum of fractional-order systems is proposed. The proposed method is rigorously derived based on the memory principle of Grünwald–Letnikov derivative so that it is generally applicable and even well compatible with integer-order systems. Three classical examples, which are the fractional-order Lorenz system, fractional-order Duffing oscillator, and 4-dimensional fractional-order Chen system, are respectively employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for incommensurate, nonautonomous and low effective order systems as well as hyperchaotic systems. The simulation results suggest that the proposed method is indeed superior to the existing methods in accuracy and correctness.},

This paper aims to briefly survey recent results in this field. First, the stability analysis for switched systems is reviewed. We focus on the stability analysis for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching, and we highlight necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. After a brief review of the stability analysis under restricted switching and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the switching stabilization problem is studied, and a variety of switching stabilization methods found in the literature are outlined. Then the switching stabilizability problem is investigated, that is under what condition it is possible to stabilize a switched system by properly designing switching control laws. Note that the switching stabilizability problem has been one of the most elusive problems in the switched systems literature. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stabilizability of switched linear systems is described here.},

This paper comes from the desks of the key ROS Navigation maintainers to review and analyze the state of the art of robotics navigation in ROS~2. This includes new systems without parallel in ROS~1 or other similar mobile robotics frameworks. We discuss current research products and historically robust methods that provide differing behaviors and support for most every robot type. This survey consists of overviews, comparisons, and expert insights organized by the fundamental problems in the field. Some of these implementations have yet to be described in literature and many have not been benchmarked relative to others.

In opposite to the classic proportional integral derivative (PID), the FOPID controller is defined by five independent parameters. Hence, it is more customizable and, potentially, more precise on condition that the values of fractional integration and differentiation orders are properly selected. However, a number of operations and the time required to calculate the output signal continuously increase. This can be a significant problem considering the limitations of a microcontroller, including memory size and a constant sampling time of the set-up analog-to-digital (ADC) converters. In the article, three solutions are considered, and results obtained in the experiments are presented.},

The objective of these expressions was to solve fractional differential equations or other problems subject to fractional constraints.

The current research is aimed at reducing the overshoot in the response of a double-acting pneumatic actuator, namely, the IPA positioning system's reaction time. The pneumatic system was modeled using an autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model structure, and the control strategy was implemented using a fuzzy fractional order proportional integral derivative (fuzzy FOPID) employing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. This approach was used to determine the optimal controller parameters. A comparison study has been conducted to prove the advantages of utilizing a PSO fuzzy FOPID controller over PSO fuzzy PID. The controller tuning algorithm was validated and tested using a pneumatic actuator system in both simulation and real environments. From the standpoint of time-domain performance metrics, such as rising time (tr), settling time (ts), and overshoot (OS\%), the PSO fuzzy FOPID controller outperforms the PSO Fuzzy PID controller in terms of dynamic performance.},

  abstract = {The subject of this PhD dissertation is an application of the theory of fractional order systems described in the form of state space equations for the analysis of the electrical circuits containing elements of different, fractional orders. For this purpose, it was necessary to obtain an analytical form of solutions to the state equations - for common and many different fractional orders, for selected fractional definitions (Conformable Fractional Derivative and Caputo) with step and harmonic input signals. In the next step, two ladder systems of fractional order were made. For this purpose the ladder circuit which behaves as fractional order system was designed, using the expansion of the power function into a Continued Fraction Expansion - so that any central pulsation could be selected. An algorithm that allows to design ladder systems with orders ranging from 0 to 1 was given, which determines the values of parameters of passive elements included in these systems. Then, proposed algorithm was used to make two ladder systems with different fractional orders. In the next part of this dissertation, the parameters of the ladder systems models (for the case of classical and CFD differential operator) has been estimated. This allowed for the simulation of voltage waveforms in electric circuits containing two ladder systems. This was achieved using a parametric estimation procedure using data from laboratory tests of voltage characteristics of RCα circuits. In order to verify the theoretical considerations, a series of laboratory tests - both in the time and frequency domains - of selected electrical circuits consisting of two ladder circuits and additional resistors were performed. At the same time, simulation tests of voltage waveforms in the mentioned circuits were carried out using the previously obtained analytical solutions, in the case of selected derivative definitions, taking into account many different fractional orders. Then, a comparative analysis of the experimental and theoretical characteristics was performed, which allowed to demonstrate suitability of application of fractional calculus with many different fractional orders in order to improve the accuracy of the mathematical model in comparison to the model using the first, classical derivative.},

This paper addresses the effectiveness of the FOPID controller on a level control of single conical system in real time. It is one of the classical nonlinear control problem and its shape not only contributes the proper mixing of liquids and also guarantee to drainage of solid wastes. This study, a dual loop controller is proposed and constructed with a master process and slave process for a level control of a single conical tank system. In the slave process, the output response obtained by the traditional PID controller combined with the conical tank reference model and compared with the output response of the master process. The obtained error signal is used to dynamically correct the parameters of the FOPID controller in the master process. The tuning of FOPID controller is a challenging task due to its presence of extra parameters and it efficiently carried out by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The obtained result reveals that the Proposed PSO optimized FOPID controller with reference model demonstrated the better set point tracking, smooth controller response than other conventional integer order controllers.},

  abstract = {FOMCON is a new fractional-order modeling and control toolbox for MATLAB. It offers a set of tools for researchers in the field of fractional-order control. In this paper, we present an overview of the toolbox, motivation for its development and relation to other toolboxes devoted to fractional calculus. We discuss all of the major modules of the FOMCON toolbox as well as relevant mathematical concepts. Three modules are presented. The main module is used for fractional-order system analysis. The identification module allows identifying a fractional system from either time or frequency domain data. The control module focuses on fractional-order PID controller design, tuning and optimization, but also has basic support for design of fractional lead-lag compensators and TID controllers. Finally, a Simulink blockset is presented. It allows more sophisticated modeling tasks to be carried out.},

  abstract = {The interest towards using Fractional-order (FO) PID controllers in the industry is mainly fueled by the fact that these controllers have two additional “tuning knobs” that can be used to adjust the control law in a way that would benefit the control loop. However, there are certain points that are rarely addressed in literature, namely: (1) What are the particular advantages (in concrete numbers) of FOPID controllers versus conventional, integer-order (IO) PID controllers in the light of complexities arising in the implementation of the former? (2) For real-time implementation of FOPID controllers, approximations are used that are equivalent to high order linear controllers. What, then, is the benefit of using FOPID controllers? In the present paper, we attempt to address these issues by reviewing recent literature in the field and by providing relevant analysis and recommendations.},

  abstract = {Distinct fractional models of falling object with linear and quadratic air resistive forces are explored under Caputo fractional derivative. Analytical solutions to each model are extracted from which the motion of fall can be vividly observed. The contribution of nonlinearity to the fractional model is particularly conceived from the solutions. Unlike the traditional results from an integer derivative model, a rich phenomenon is present under the proposed fractional models, which are shown to be truly converging back to the traditional one. The short time perturbation and large time asymptotic formulae are also derived. Instead of attaining a terminal speed, the solutions under some fractional models suggest that objects travel either at an increased speed overwhelming the gravitational force or decelerate to stop asymptotically. In the case of quadratic air resistance, a straightforward power series solution around the initial time having a short radius of convergence under Caputo fractional derivative and a powerful asymptotic series solution possessing an infinite convergence radius under the infinite base fractional differentiation are also presented. It can be concluded from analysis of the ideal falling object motion that even though novel physical implications are observed from the modified fractional models, the fractional model as well as the definition of fractional derivative literally affect the physical motion in-depth, which may require proper justification.},

The WSCC 9-bus test system and a realistic 1,479-bus model of the Irish transmission system are employed to test and compare the examined FOCs with their integer-order versions.},

By using the piecewise Lyapunov function method and taking a tradeoff between the increasing scale and the decreasing scale of the Lyapunov function at switching times, the maximum dwell time for admissible switching signals is obtained and the extended stability results for switched systems in a nonlinear setting are first derived. Then, based on the discretized Lyapunov function method, the switching stabilization problem for linear context is solved. By contrasting with the contributions available in the literature, we do not require that all the switching behaviors of the switching system under consideration are stabilizing. More specifically, even if all the subsystems governing the continuous dynamics are not stable and some of the switching behaviors are destabilizing, the stability of the switched system can still be retained. A numerical example is given to illustrate the validity of the proposed results.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problems of low mapping accuracy, slow path planning efficiency, and high radar frequency requirements in the process of mobile robot mapping and navigation in an indoor environment, this paper proposes a four-wheel drive adaptive robot positioning and navigation system based on ROS. By comparing and analyzing the mapping effects of various 2D-SLAM algorithms (Gmapping, Karto SLAM, and Hector SLAM), the Karto SLAM algorithm is used for map building. By comparing the Dijkstra algorithm with the A* algorithm, the A* algorithm is used for heuristic searches, which improves the efficiency of path planning. The DWA algorithm is used for local path planning, and real-time path planning is carried out by combining sensor data, which have a good obstacle avoidance performance. The mathematical model of four-wheel adaptive robot sliding steering was established, and the URDF model of the mobile robot was established under a ROS system. The map environment was built in Gazebo, and the simulation experiment was carried out by integrating lidar and odometer data, so as to realize the functions of mobile robot scanning mapping and autonomous obstacle avoidance navigation. The communication between the ROS system and STM32 is realized, the packaging of the ROS chassis node is completed, and the ROS chassis node has the function of receiving speed commands and feeding back odometer data and TF transformation, and the slip rate of the four-wheel robot in situ steering is successfully measured, making the chassis pose more accurate. Simulation tests and experimental verification show that the system has a high precision in environment map building and can achieve accurate navigation tasks.},
